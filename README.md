# 🌍 Solar System Simulation (Three.js)

## **🔹 Introduction**  
This interactive 3D Solar System Simulation is a web-based project built using Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser. It visually represents all 8 planets orbiting the Sun in a realistic and animated fashion. The simulation is designed to provide a basic understanding of planetary motion and an immersive space experience.
